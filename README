Install:
--------
	git clone https://github.com/zillevdr/vdr-plugin-softhddevice-drm.git
	cd vdr-plugin-softhddevice-drm
	For mmal (Raspberry Pi 2) set MMAL to 1 in Makefile.
	make
	make install

OpenGL/ES:
---------
	OpenGL/ES support is based on the work of Stefan Braun
	(https://github.com/louisbraun/softhddevice-openglosd)

	This enables GPU accelerated OSD rendering.
	OpenGL/ES support is enabled, if gles2, egl and gbm are found on the system
	To disable OpenGL/ES support (if autodetected), simply build with

	GLES=0 make

Requirement:
---------
        No running X!

	media-video/vdr (version >=2.2.x)
		Video Disk Recorder - turns a pc into a powerful set top box
		for DVB.
		http://www.tvdr.de/

	media-video/ffmpeg
		MMAL (RaspberryPi) 	version >=3.2
		v4l2-request (Rockchip, Allwinner)	WIP LE version

	media-libs/alsa-lib

Setup: /etc/vdr/setup.conf
------
	softhddevice.MakePrimary = 0
	0 = no change, 1 make softhddevice primary at start

	softhddevice.HideMainMenuEntry = 0
	0 = show softhddevice main menu entry, 1 = hide entry

	softhddevice.AudioDelay = 0
	+n or -n ms
	delay audio or delay video

	softhddevice.AudioPassthrough = 0
	0 = none, 1 = PCM, 2 = MPA, 4 = AC-3, 8 = EAC-3, -X disable

	for PCM/AC-3/EAC-3 the pass-through device is used and the audio
	stream is passed undecoded to the output device.
	z.b. 12 = AC-3+EAC-3, 13 = PCM+AC-3+EAC-3
	note: MPA/DTS/TrueHD/... aren't supported yet
	negative values disable passthrough

	softhddevice.AudioDownmix = 0
	0 = none, 1 = downmix
	Use ffmpeg downmix of AC-3/EAC-3 audio to stereo.

	softhddevice.AudioSoftvol = 0
	0 = off, use hardware volume control
	1 = on, use software volume control

	softhddevice.AudioNormalize = 0
	0 = off, 1 = enable audio normalize

	softhddevice.AudioMaxNormalize = 0
	maximal volume factor/1000 of the normalize filter

	softhddevice.AudioCompression = 0
	0 = off, 1 = enable audio compression

	softhddevice.AudioMaxCompression = 0
	maximal volume factor/1000 of the compression filter

	softhddevice.AudioStereoDescent = 0
	reduce volume level (/1000) for stereo sources

	softhddevice.AudioBufferTime = 0
	0 = default (600 ms)
	1 - 1000 = size of the buffer in ms

Commandline:
------------
	Use vdr -h to see the command line arguments supported by the plugin.

    -a audio_device
    -p device for pass-through
    -c audio mixer channel name

SVDRP:
------
	PLAY Url    Play the media from the given url.
	Tested extension: *.mp3, *.mp4, *.m3u, *.m3u8

	Play a local file:
	svdrpsend plug softhddevice-drm PLAY /path_to_file/media_file.mp4

	Play a playlist inside ConfigDirectory:
	svdrpsend plug softhddevice-drm PLAY playlist_name.m3u

	Play a media file from web:
	svdrpsend plug softhddevice-drm PLAY http://www.media-server/path_to_file/media_file.mp4
